# WebViewer 3D

WebViewer 3D allows you to view, annotate and collaborate on 3D models.

- Traverse 3D model object tree
- Toggle visibility of objects
- Use the same annotation capabilities as you do on PDFs, MS Office and videos
- Annotation hotspots to quickly navigate you to the annotated view
- Measure in 3D space by snapping to vertices
- View render, wireframe or vertex normals

This sample uses the [3D addon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pdftron/webviewer-3d) for WebViewer. It allows the loading of 3D models in .gltf or .glb formats.
